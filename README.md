# Hey! I'm Helena 👋

I live in the picturesque town of Whakatane in New Zealand 🌄. But I'm not just a resident of this beautiful place; I'm also on an exciting journey to become a software developer 🚀, transitioning from my previous role as a customer care queen 👑.

## 🌟 My Mission

My journey into software development is driven by a deep desire to make a difference behind the scenes. I'm passionate about using technology to care for not only those around me but also people all over the world 🌍. I believe in the power of software to solve problems and improve lives.

## 📚 Current Learning

I'm currently sharpening my skills and expanding my tech knowledge through the Mission Ready Institute 🎓. I'm on the verge of launching into the real world of software development, armed with a diverse skill set and a determination to make an impact.

## 💼 Projects

During my time at Mission Ready, I've had the opportunity to work on some fascinating projects that showcase my growth and abilities. You can explore these projects in my GitHub repository. Each project represents a milestone on my journey from customer care to coding.

Feel free to reach out, collaborate, or just have a chat about technology, coding, or making a positive impact in the world. Let's connect and make the world a better place through code! 🌟
